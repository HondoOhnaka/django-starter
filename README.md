# Django Starter #

*Description*: A super simple Django starter template.

I'm sick of wanting to test out a django app and need to generate the whole app to get it started. 
This is just a customized project that can quickly be cloned and used out of the box.

It Provides:

* stylesheet
* media/static directory configuration
* a basic Class-based generic CRUD form module
* that's about it.

## Requirements: ##

1. Django (1.4 is what I used, but it probably supports 1.3 or 1.2)
2. that be it.
